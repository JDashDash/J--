# J--: Contribute to the project

In this document you will find information to contribute to the project.

## Report a problem, a bug

Windows errors can happen, I advise you to search the Internet **before** sending a message in the
[issues](https://github.com/JDashDash/J--/issues)_ of the project.
The Microsoft community may have already talked about it on a forum.

Bugs are unfortunately common in every IT project, the best way to inform developers/developer is to report them.

If you are faced with a problem or a bug while running the program, I invite you to let us know in the _[issues](https://github.com/JDashDash/J--/issues)_ of the project .

If you have a discord account, I advise you to go directly to it, it will be easier for communication.


## Suggestions

I am open to any proposal, my goal is to create a logical language that pleases users.

Do not hesitate to send me your suggestions and ideas to bring new features or improve the project.

You can let me know in _[pull requests](https://github.com/JDashDash/J--/pulls)_ or on the discord server in the respective channel.


## Project Helpers & Classic Members

The **Project Helpers** are volunteers who participate in debates organized by myself around the language, we discuss syntaxes and updates that will be added.
Applications can be found on the discord server.

Regular members can submit ideas on the discord server as well, like on github in _[pull requests](https://github.com/JDashDash/J--/pulls)_ :)!
